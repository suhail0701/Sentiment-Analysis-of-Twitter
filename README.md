# Sentimental-Analysis-of-Twitter
Twitter Sentiment Analysis is the process of computationally identifying and categorizing tweets expressed in a piece of text, especially in order to determine whether the writerâ€™s attitude towards a particular topic, product, etc. is positive, negative, or neutral.
In this Project i have done twitter sentiment analysis with Natural Language Processing using the nltk library with python.
